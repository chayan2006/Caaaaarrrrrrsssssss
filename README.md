🧠 Sentiment Analysis for Law Feedback System
📖 Overview

This project aims to assist government bodies or organizations in analyzing public sentiment toward newly passed laws or policies. Whenever a law is proposed or enacted, people share thousands of comments online — reading and analyzing all of them manually is difficult, time-consuming, and prone to human error.

This web-based tool automates that process using Sentiment Analysis and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

🚀 Features
📝 1. File Upload & Comment Processing

Users can upload comments in any supported file format (CSV, TXT, JSON, etc.). The system processes all comments automatically.

📊 2. Sentiment Summary & Visualization

Generates a summary report showing the overall sentiment:

✅ Positive

❌ Negative

⚪ Neutral

Displays pie charts and bar graphs to visualize sentiment distribution.

🔑 3. Keyword Extraction

Highlights key terms and recurring topics from the comments, helping decision-makers identify what people are talking about most.

📁 4. Sentiment by Provision Report

Shows sentiment distribution by domain or provision of the law — making it clear which sections are well-received and which face criticism.

🧾 5. Exportable Reports

All analysis results can be exported for further use or for record-keeping.

🎯 Purpose

This project aims to support data-driven policy decisions. By understanding the tone of public feedback, government agencies can make better judgments and take appropriate actions to address citizens' concerns.

🧩 Current Status

The project is under development.

Core sentiment analysis and visualization features are being built.

Future updates will include real-time comment analysis, advanced NLP models, and interactive dashboards.
